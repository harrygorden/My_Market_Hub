   ## Task Analysis
   - Purpose: This app should act as a central hub that allows me to aggregate market information that is important to me for my trading strategies into one place.
   - Technical Requirements: This app runs in the Anvil platform and needs to be written with that in mind.
   - Implementation Steps: Code cannot be tested locally as it will need to be run in the Anvil environment.
   - Quality Standards: This app is only for my use but it's still important that it is well-structured and follows best practices, as well as accurate as I will use it to make trading decisions.

## Anvil.works Platform Understanding

### What is Anvil?
Anvil.works is a full-stack Python web app development platform that allows developers to build web applications entirely in Python without needing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The platform provides:
- A drag-and-drop UI designer
- Server-side Python code
- Client-side Python code (compiled to JavaScript)
- Built-in database
- User authentication
- Email integration
- Third-party service integration

### Key Anvil Components
1. **App Structure**
   - **Client-side code**: Python code that runs in the browser (compiled to JavaScript)
   - **Server-side code**: Python code that runs on Anvil's servers
   - **Server modules**: Backend functionality accessible via Anvil's RPC system
   - **Uplink**: Connect external Python processes to your Anvil app

2. **Forms and Components**
   - Forms are the building blocks of Anvil UIs
   - Components include text boxes, buttons, data grids, plots, etc.
   - Each form has a Python class with event handlers

3. **Data Tables**
   - Built-in database service for storing application data
   - SQL-like capabilities but with Python syntax
   - Can be accessed from client or server code

4. **Services**
   - **Users service**: Authentication and user management
   - **Email service**: Sending and receiving emails
   - **Scheduled tasks**: Run code at specified intervals
   - **Background tasks**: Run long-running processes

### Anvil-Specific Constraints
1. **Code Execution Environment**
   - Client-side Python has limited access to Python libraries
   - Server-side code has access to many Python packages, but not all
   - Custom Python packages require the Private Server plan

2. **Application Structure**
   - Main entry point is typically `Form1` or a designated startup form
   - Navigation managed through `open_form()` and similar functions
   - Code must follow Anvil's event-driven model

3. **Database Limitations**
   - Data tables have size limits based on your plan
   - Complex queries may require optimization
   - No direct SQL access (must use Anvil's Data Tables API)

4. **Project Structure**
   - Python modules should be organized in the "Server Modules" section
   - Assets (images, files) stored in the "Assets" section
   - No direct file system access on standard plans

### Implementation Guidelines for This App
1. **Worker File Organization**
   - `Main.py`: Orchestrator file managing complex workflows
   - `Retrieve_Emails.py`: Email retrieval functionality
   - `DB_Utils.py`: Database operations
   - `Shared_Functions.py`: Common utility functions
   - `Extract_ES_Newsletter_Sections.py`: E-Mini Futures newsletter parsing
   - `Extract_Flow_Newsletter_Sections.py`: Flow and market structure newsletter parsing

2. **Anvil-Specific Coding Practices**
   - Use `anvil.server.call()` for client-to-server communication
   - Use `anvil.server.callable` decorator for server functions
   - Use Anvil's Data Tables API for database operations
   - Handle UI events through form methods
   - Use Anvil's built-in components when possible

3. **Testing Constraints**
   - Code cannot be tested locally, only in the Anvil environment
   - Use Anvil's built-in console for debugging
   - Set up test functions with the `@anvil.server.callable` decorator for quick testing

4. **API Integration**
   - Use `anvil.http` for HTTP requests from server code
   - Use `anvil.js.window.fetch` for client-side requests when necessary
   - Store API keys in Anvil's Secrets service

5. **Best Practices**
   - Keep server functions small and focused
   - Cache expensive operations when possible
   - Use Anvil's built-in error handling
   - Implement proper user input validation
   - Structure code for maintainability with clear function names and documentation

    # Initialize form
    self.init_components(**properties)
    
    # Load initial data
    self.refresh_data()
    
  def refresh_data(self):

  if filter_by:
    return app_tables.market_data.search(category=filter_by)
  else:
    return app_tables.market_data.search()
```

**Database Operations:**
```python
@anvil.server.callable
def save_analysis(data_dict):
  # Add validation
  if not data_dict.get('title'):
    raise ValueError("Analysis must have a title")
    
  # Save to database
  return app_tables.analysis.add_row(
    title=data_dict['title'],
    content=data_dict['content'],
    created=datetime.now(),
    category=data_dict.get('category', 'general')
  )
```

**Email Processing:**
```python
@anvil.server.callable
def process_new_emails():
  # Get new emails
  emails = anvil.google.mail.inbox(label="INBOX")
  
  # Process each email
  for email in emails:
    if is_newsletter(email):
      process_newsletter(email)
```

## Implementation Planning
   ```markdown
   ## Implementation Plan
   1. This app is designed to run in the Anvil platform.
      - Ensure that all changes are designed to run in the Anvil platform.
      - Do not try to run any commands locally as they will need to be called in the Anvil environment.
   2. Ensure that new functions are always written to the correct worker file.
      - Main.py is designed to be the orchestrator file that manages the workflows for complex functions.
      - Retrieve_Emails.py is designed to retrieve emails from the specified GMail inbox.
      - DB_Utils.py is designed to handle all database operations.
      - Shared_Functions should house scripts that handle functions that are used by multiple worker files.
      - Extract_ES_Newsletter_Sections.py is designed to extract the sections of the daily newsletter regarding E-Mini Futures.
      - Extract_Flow_Newsletter_Sections.py is designed to extract the sections of the daily newsletter regarding flow and general market structure.
   ```
