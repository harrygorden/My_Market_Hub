   ## Task Analysis
   - Purpose: This app should act as a central hub that allows me to aggregate market information that is important to me for my trading strategies into one place.
   - Technical Requirements: This app runs in the Anvil platform and needs to be written with that in mind.
   - Implementation Steps: Code cannot be tested locally as it will need to be run in the Anvil environment, but can be tested via uplink.
   - Quality Standards: This app is only for my use but it's still important that it is well-structured and follows best practices, as well as accurate as I will use it to make trading decisions.

## Anvil.works Platform Understanding

### What is Anvil?
Anvil.works is a full-stack Python web app development platform that allows developers to build web applications entirely in Python without needing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The platform provides:
- A drag-and-drop UI designer
- Server-side Python code
- Client-side Python code (compiled to JavaScript)
- Built-in database
- User authentication
- Email integration
- Third-party service integration

### Key Anvil Components
1. **App Structure**
   - **Client-side code**: Python code that runs in the browser (compiled to JavaScript)
   - **Server-side code**: Python code that runs on Anvil's servers
   - **Server modules**: Backend functionality accessible via Anvil's RPC system
   - **Uplink**: Connect external Python processes to your Anvil app

2. **Forms and Components**
   - Forms are the building blocks of Anvil UIs
   - Components include text boxes, buttons, data grids, plots, etc.
   - Each form has a Python class with event handlers

3. **Data Tables**
   - Built-in database service for storing application data
   - SQL-like capabilities but with Python syntax
   - Can be accessed from client or server code

4. **Services**
   - **Users service**: Authentication and user management
   - **Email service**: Sending and receiving emails
   - **Scheduled tasks**: Run code at specified intervals
   - **Background tasks**: Run long-running processes

### Anvil-Specific Constraints
1. **Code Execution Environment**
   - Client-side Python has limited access to Python libraries
   - Server-side code has access to many Python packages, but not all
   - Custom Python packages require the Private Server plan

2. **Application Structure**
   - Main entry point is typically `Form1` or a designated startup form
   - Navigation managed through `open_form()` and similar functions
   - Code must follow Anvil's event-driven model

3. **Database Limitations**
   - Data tables have size limits based on your plan
   - Complex queries may require optimization
   - No direct SQL access (must use Anvil's Data Tables API)

4. **Project Structure**
   - Python modules should be organized in the "Server Modules" section
   - Assets (images, files) stored in the "Assets" section
   - No direct file system access on standard plans

### Testing with Uplink
1. **Uplink Connection**
   - Run `Uplink_Apps/connect_uplink.py` to establish connection to Anvil
   - Uses uplink key stored in `Uplink_Apps/.env` as "AnvilServerUplinkCode"
   - After connecting, an interactive command prompt (Anvil>) will appear
   - At this prompt, you can:
     - Call Anvil server functions using `anvil.server.call('function_name', arg1, arg2)`
     - Type `help` to see available commands
     - Type `list_functions` to see available server functions
     - Type `exit` or `quit` to disconnect and exit

### Implementation Guidelines for This App
1. **Worker File Organization**
   - `Main.py`: Orchestrator file managing complex workflows
   - `Retrieve_Emails.py`: Email retrieval functionality
   - `DB_Utils.py`: Database operations
   - `Shared_Functions.py`: Common utility functions
   - `Extract_ES_Newsletter_Sections.py`: E-Mini Futures newsletter parsing
   - `Extract_Flow_Newsletter_Sections.py`: Flow and market structure newsletter parsing

2. **Anvil-Specific Coding Practices**
   - Use `anvil.server.call()` for client-to-server communication
   - Use `anvil.server.callable` decorator for server functions
   - Use Anvil's Data Tables API for database operations
   - Handle UI events through form methods
   - Use Anvil's built-in components when possible

3. **Logging Best Practices**
   - Use concise but thorough logging messages that provide context
   - Include timestamps in logs for temporal tracking
   - Add appropriate level tags (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to differentiate severity
   - Include relevant variables and state information for troubleshooting
   - Use structured logging when possible for easier parsing
   - In error logs, include both the error message and its context
   - Avoid excessive logging that might impact performance
   - Use log categories to help filter logs by component

4. **API Integration**
   - Use `anvil.http` for HTTP requests from server code
   - Use `anvil.js.window.fetch` for client-side requests when necessary
   - Store API keys in Anvil's Secrets service

5. **Best Practices**
   - Keep server functions small and focused
   - Cache expensive operations when possible
   - Use Anvil's built-in error handling
   - Implement proper user input validation
   - Structure code for maintainability with clear function names and documentation

## Implementation Planning
   ```markdown
   ## Implementation Plan
   1. This app is designed to run in the Anvil platform.
      - Ensure that all changes are designed to run in the Anvil platform.
      - Use uplink connection for testing server functions locally.
      - Keep logging concise but thorough to aid troubleshooting.
   2. Ensure that new functions are always written to the correct worker file.
      - Main.py is designed to be the orchestrator file that manages the workflows for complex functions.
      - Retrieve_Emails.py is designed to retrieve emails from the specified GMail inbox.
      - DB_Utils.py is designed to handle all database operations.
      - Shared_Functions should house scripts that handle functions that are used by multiple worker files.
      - Extract_ES_Newsletter_Sections.py is designed to extract the sections of the daily newsletter regarding E-Mini Futures.
      - Extract_Flow_Newsletter_Sections.py is designed to extract the sections of the daily newsletter regarding flow and general market structure.
